### Step 1 – Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)

First, [open a terminal window](http//www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw7Nd67_aFw).

Next, copy & paste the following into a terminal window and hit return.

```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
brew doctor
```

You will be offered to install the *Command Line Developer Tools* from *Apple*. Confirm by clicking *Install*. After the installation finished, continue installing *Homebrew* by hitting return again.

### Step 2 – Installing [Git](https://git-scm.com)

Copy & paste the following into the terminal window and hit return.

```shell
brew install git
```

Now that we git installed, you can clone this repo with the following command. You'll want to navigate to a folder in terminal where you'd like to store these files. If you need help, here's a [gentle introduction to navigation in the terminal](https://computers.tutsplus.com/tutorials/navigating-the-terminal-a-gentle-introduction--mac-3855).

```shell
git clone https://github.com/lobe/iOS-bootstrap.git
```
